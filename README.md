# ajax-project

A dynamic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript solo project.

A web application for art enthusiasts who want to discover interesting works on
display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art that they may have otherwise never
seen before.

The search function returns a randomized list of objects that have
the queried keyword or keyphrase in any of the object's information or documentation,
displaying information about the object and where to find it in The Met galleries.
The user can then add the randomized objects to their 'Must-See List' to view at The Met.
